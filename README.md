## Local Dev (probably not needed with our preview environments)
run `npm install` then `gulp`

then run `bundle exec jekyll serve`

If you are having issues with the versions of ruby try running the following on the root of the project:
 - `brew install rbenv`
 - `rbenv install 2.6.3`

## How to demo

The scripts to set up the custom demo are [here](scripts/).
